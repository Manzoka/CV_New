        dissatisfied. The rate of disruptive innovation is  continuously accelerating. Nine out of ten companies believe
        their industry will be digitally disrupted, yet only one in six of them said their companies are responding with
        a bold strategy at scale (McKinsey, 2017). New digitally enabled entrants are reshaping the competitive space and
        new technologies reduced the barriers to entry.</p>
